## Usage

There are two directories:

- **`mast3rsoda`** has all the files required to compile the `.hex` file which you can then flash onto the board.
It's pretty straight forward if you've use qmk. If not, in there is a link to the newbs guide which explains things pretty well.

- **`via_config`** is pretty self-explanatory I think.
